## Features

•	REST API: Embracing the current trend in software development, this application is built around a robust RESTful API architecture.
  It ensures smooth communication between the front end and back end, enabling seamless data exchange.
  
•	One-to-Many Comment System: Each blog post is equipped with a dynamic comment section. Leveraging the power of one-to-many mapping, users can leave multiple comments on a single blog post.

•	User Authentication & Authorization: Ensuring the security of the application, this project incorporates user authentication and authorization.
  Users can register and sign in, and based on their roles, they gain access to specific functionalities.

•	Seamless Security with JWT: To enhance the security experience, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are employed. 
  The implementation of JWT tokens ensures that user interactions are secure and authenticated without compromising user experience.

•	MVC Architecture for Maintainability: The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, enhancing the readability and maintainability of the codebase. 
  It ensures a clear separation of concerns and a structured approach to development.

•	Profiles for Easy Execution: Different execution environments often require distinct configurations. 
  This project incorporates profiles for development, testing, and production. This allows the code to be executed seamlessly in various environments, with appropriate database configurations and settings.

## Technologies Used

•	Spring Boot: The backbone of the application, Spring Boot simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications, allowing us to focus on business logic.

•	Spring MVC: The Spring Model-View-Controller framework facilitates the development of flexible and organized web applications.

•	Hibernate ORM: The project leverages Hibernate ORM, a powerful Object-Relational Mapping tool, to interact with the database using Java objects.

•	Lombok: This project takes advantage of Lombok to reduce boilerplate code, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

•	Spring Security: Ensuring application security, Spring Security provides authentication and authorization functionalities.
